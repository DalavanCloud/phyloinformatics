# Plan

- Give talk

- Walk through web site with examples, have them do some

â€” have some on touch monitor


- class exercise - how many species that you are interested din have synonyms? How can you find these? Do your results change with names?

- Class exercise (in groups)

As class discuss criteria for an ideal tree viewer

In groups, find a large tree viewing app, say one of the examples, or online/ App Store, and investigate how well it does.
